# HTML & CSS Final Project :tw-2705:
Hello, I'm :tw-2b50: **Doa'a Osama Khalaf**, a software engineer. During my time at the academy, as part of the full-stack curriculum, we were tasked with creating a website using only HTML and CSS, without relying on Bootstrap or similar frameworks. This hands-on approach allowed us to build the website from scratch, providing a deeper understanding of page structure and other essential concepts.
